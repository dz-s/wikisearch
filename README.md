# wikisearch

"A simple one is to recreate Google. Find some text documents (I used a dump of Wikipedia in txt format) then use tf-idf to search based on keywords.
Another one is an article summary bot. Use nltk to determine the word complexity of each sentence in a newspaper article then show the user only the 5 most complex sentences to get a summary of the article. That one is a popular reddit bot too."

Thanks for that idea https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/6t7tfn/nlp_project_ideas/dlinvhd/.
